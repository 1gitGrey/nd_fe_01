[]CHECKPOINT — avoiding distractions, hypothesize what it would take to get from "stuck" to solution.
(Give detail. to the known values that give backbone to the problem)
```


In order to land a job and get "unstuck" takes a lot of preparation and focus. Yet, the solution is very clear. The position is the solution. The challenge then is how to bridge the gap between who. you are now and the position.  The same can be said about any programming issue. The solution is clear. The way we get there is the problem. Yet no problem is so tough that it cannot be broken down into simple well positioned  operations and definitions. Start by structuring all discrete, finite values  (variables, requirements, due dates, years experience). From start to the solution, you should have an early stepping stone map towards the end-goal.

<notifications class="danger">[fa-info]<br />Inform yourself of your problem’s lexicon and libraries.<br> ( Begin a working dictionary of useful terms in your desired role)

```
[] CHECKPOINT — as you expand your lexicon, try placing them on the stepping stone map
[] CHECKPOINT — try breaking things down into easy steps, name the procedures, and look for patterns
[] CHECKPOINT — ask yourselwhatwould this step need to bring it to the next step. if you can’t f
find anything given or prescribed. Create the helper yourself.
[] Seek your lexicon and sites like StackOverflow for precedence and help.
```

This may not be entirely correct or even remotely so but recognizing terms or even misidentifying
a block of code gives a gateway to insight from peers. It is much easier to pinpoint somone’s code error or misuse of certain terms. Having the lexicon will embolden novice use such sites which often seem too high-level to even consider leaving a question. Language can place you firmly on either side of a project — A) towards quit/fail B) towards success/growth. It will allow you to parse out  patterns from other examples and see how custom helper function , variables, etc. bridge steps between stones towards solution.

Often times, getting out into fresh air, laughing , and enjoying life is all you need to get out of a rut. And even more often than that, is the tranmission of ideas that can lead to breakthroughs as well as "right place, right time" or  "it’s not what you know, its who you know " moments leading to hard-to-come-by connections with top employers. And most obviously, reading thorugh these forums — one could arge any single project can be solved by using oo
